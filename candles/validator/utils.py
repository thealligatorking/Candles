    Processes prediction requests to miners in batches with rate limiting.

    This function handles the distribution of prediction requests across multiple miners

    overwhelming the network. It collects responses from all miners and tracks which
    miners are actively responding.

    The function implements a batching strategy where:
        - Miners are processed in groups based on validator.config.neuron.batch_size
